# Reflection Based Radar Object Model

<img align="right" src="doc/img/fzd_logo.jpg" width="100" />

This model is a Reflection Based Radar Model based on the [Modular OSMP Framework](https://gitlab.com/tuda-fzd/perception-sensor-modeling/modular-osmp-framework) by FZD.
It is a highly parameterizable sensor system model including detection calculation and object tracking simulation.
The model received radar reflection data calculated in a simulation tool beforehand e.g. with ray tracing.
The model outputs are radar detections and detected moving objects.<br><br>

## Modeling Approach

### Modeling Framework

The outer layer of the model is the [Modular OSMP Framework](https://gitlab.com/tuda-fzd/perception-sensor-modeling/modular-osmp-framework) by FZD.
It specifies ways in which models using the [Open Simulation Interface (OSI)](https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface) are to be packaged for their use in simulation environments using [FMI 2.0](https://fmi-standard.org).

The actual logic of the model is packed in so called strategies.
This is where the magic happens.
The `apply()` function of the strategy is called by the `do_calc()` function of the Framework.
There are four subsequent strategies as shown in the image below.

### Modeling of FFT and windowing processing by [Fouriertracing](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/17545/1/Dissertation_Martin_Holder_2021.pdf)

The reflections of e.g. a raytracer are the input of the model.
As a first step, every reflection is interpreted as a delta-peak and sorted into the corresponding range, doppler and azimuth bin based on the FFT discretization of the radar sensor system (elevation right now not considered).
Next, the delta-peaks are smeared with a window function lookup-table into the neighboring cells of the radar cuboid (3D FFT output) under consideration of the complex power.
The result is the complex radar cuboid at the current timestamp.
The general process is visualized by the following pictures.
On the left side the smearing of the delta-peak into the adjacent bins due to the window function is shown.
The picture on the right side visualizes the superposition of two different delta-peaks based on a varying bin distance.

<img src="doc/img/delta_peak.gif" width="400" />

<img src="doc/img/multiple_delta_peaks.gif" width="400" />

Afterwards an OS-CFAR peak detection is applied to the cuboid.
The output of the DetectionSensing is an osi3::RadarDetection message.<br><br>

After transformation of the detections from the sensor's spherical coordinates to the vehicle's Cartesian coordinates, they are available as osi3::LogicalDetections.
Subsequently, the tracking-strategy is applied on the calculated logical detections.
It uses the extreme points of the detections for every object for dimension and pose estimation.
At first, position, orientation, and dimensions are estimated as the detected object state.
The detected objects are compared to a list of previously detected and tracked objects and thereby added, updated or possibly deleted.
The track logic can be specified in the model profile.
It specifies e.g. the number of consecutive cycles an object has to be detected to create a new track or how many cycles an object is tracked without any detection.
Therefore, objects that are hidden now, but where previously detected, are still tracked estimating their movement by either using ground truth information or by predictions based on detected objects of the previous time steps.
The estimation of the object dimensions is also considered and filtered over several cycles.
If an object is no longer detected over a defined number of cycles, it is deleted from the list.
Consideration of the class uncertainties is provided by the model architecture, as well.
The output of the tracking module is a list of tracked objects.

## Parameterization

The profiles are parameterized in the files `profile_*.hpp.in`.
The parameters are defined in the files `profile.hpp.in`.
The profiles can be extended by the strategies with additional parameters and values in their respective folders as in e.g. `src/model/strategies/radar-tracking-strategy/` with `profile_struct.hpp.in` with the parameters and `profile_*.hpp.in` with the values.

The profile to be loaded for simulation is set via a model parameter defined in the `modelDescription.xml` of the FMU.
The first name in `src/model/profiles/profile_list.conf` is taken as default.
If you would like to have a different one or if your simulation master does not support the configuration of model parameters, you have to adapt the *start* value of the parameter `profile` in `src/osmp/modelDescription.in.xml`.

## Configuration

### Model name

The model's name (in this case "ReflectionBasedRadarModel") used for CMake-projects and the FMU at the end is defined in file `model_name.conf` located at `src/model`.

### Install path

When building and installing, the framework will build an FMU package into `FMU_INSTALL_DIR`, which can be used with a simulation tool that supports OSI and fills the required fields listed below.

### VariableNamingConvention

The parameter variableNamingConvention for the FMU specified within the modelDescription.xml is taken from file `variableNamingConvention.conf` located at `src/osmp`.
Possible values are "flat" or "structured".
